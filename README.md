AnimationWorking is the original version of Planning for drunks. This model features the original movement system and therefore takes an extremely long time to fully
complete and therefore I would not recommend testing the full animation however I have provided it as an insight into the code's progression.

AnimationWorking_2 is the final version of Planning for drunks. This model features the updated movement system with the new user interface and a file for testing the
functions of agentframework.py.

I have provided all of these files in my submission however should you wish to take them from github ensure the directories are as shown above.
